## Repository Overview

This is a GitHub profile repository for Amrinder Singh (zmey-xyz), containing profile documentation and animated assets. The repository is minimal and primarily serves as a showcase of the developer's skills and experience.

## Key Information

- **Assets**: Contains SVG animations (snake.svg) and XML files for profile enhancement
- **Owner**: Amrinder Singh - CS student at University of Houston with experience in AI/ML, mobile, and full-stack development

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - Main profile documentation with animated tech stack display and social links

- `snake_update.txt` - Documentation for updating snake animation coordinates and letter positions
- `Untitled-1.xml` - Legacy SVG configuration file for snake animation

## Key Assets

### Snake Animation (`snake.svg`)
- Custom animated SVG that creates a snake-like animation eating GitHub contribution graph cells
- Spells out "ZMEY" with letter-specific keyframe animations
- Uses CSS keyframes for smooth animation loops (15.1 second duration)
- Generated using https://github.com/Platane/snk but with custom modifications
- Letter positioning is configurable via coordinate updates in `snake_update.txt`
